    <h2 id="la grande motte"> La Grande Motte</h2>
    
    <p> I've visited this place two times wity my family and I have to say it's a must-visit boardwalk. Home to many of seagulls, this tourist attrations it one of my favorite places i visited in my childhood. (good times...) Anyways its on the very south of France and has a lot of boats and a huge beach surrounding it. It also has a lot of restaurants around the boradwalk. It's a lively place with beautiful scenery and a great place to go on vacation</p>

   <p>Avingon is a classic yet relaxing place to visit. I went there with my family one time and the buildings around us were so beautiful. We ate at a restaurant and I had the best french fries I have ever tasted. This city was known for being the place for the  popes in the past.
